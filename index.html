    <h1> Road Trippin' </h1>
    <head>Anybody who knows me, knows I will take a road trip for just about any reason, whether it's with a close friend, my mom, or even that weird lady from work. I once drove 14 hours to drop off a friend who decided to move to Virginia, but hey I got to see Nags Head beach along the way. My absolute favorite excuse for a road trip is to see a good waterfall.

                     Of course this one had been on my bucket list for a while. I caught a cheap flight to Buffalo, then hitched a ride with my mom and her friend to see Niagra Falls from both sides of the border.  We RV'ed across Canada to stop by Detroit on the way home to see my best friend and her new baby.

                             I love to push my agenda on my pseudo "stepdaughter" too.  I've tried to instill a travel bug in her since before she can remember.  When she was 6, we took her to see Glory Hole Falls about an hour south of Harrison, Arkansas.  That made for some interesting journal entries at school.  Still waiting for DFS to show up at my door.
