        <h1> Road Trippin' </h1>
    
        <p>Anybody who knows me, knows I will take a road trip for just about any reason, whether it's with a close friend, my mom, or even that weird lady from work. I once drove 14 hours to drop off a friend who decided to move to Virginia, but hey I got to see Nags Head beach along the way. My absolute favorite excuse for a road trip is to see a good waterfall.  Can't explain it
        </p>

        <h3> Niagra Falls </h3>
        <p>Of course this one had been on my bucket list for a while. I caught a cheap flight to Buffalo, then hitched a ride with my mom and her friend to see Niagra Falls from both sides of the border.  We RV'ed across Canada to stop by Detroit on the way home to see my best friend and her new baby.

        <h3> Glory Hole Falls - Arkansas </h3>
        <p>I love to push my agenda on my pseudo "stepdaughter" too.  I've tried to instill a travel bug in her since before she can remember.  When she was 6, we took her to see Glory Hole Falls about an hour south of Harrison, Arkansas.  That made for some interesting journal entries at school.  Still waiting for DFS to show up at my door.

        <h3> Durango, Colorodo </h3>
        <p>I got to see Durango, Colorodo when I rode along with my boyfriend to do a flooring project for a friend's mom.  I took a few interesting day trips from there to see the Four Corners, Mesa Verde National Park, and San Jaun Skyway.  One night, we got to visit Trimble Hot Springs Spa. I'm not much of a spa type, but this place was amazing.  Something mesmerizing about a hot spring, especially on a snowy night.

        <h3> Hurricane, Utah </h3>
        <p> The Four Corners was hard for me to get over.  It killed me to drive all the way to the corner of Utah just to put my toes in.  I got myself back to Utah by way of a bargain flight to Vegas. Spent one night in Vegas, Checked staying in the downtown "old strip" off my bucket list.  Took a cheap rental to Bryce Canyon for a hike worth the 4 hour drive (and 2 hours back towards Zion).  Stayed in Hurricane, Utah so we could hike Zion for the next 2 days.

        <h3> Fall Creek Falls, Tennessee </h3>
        <p> Took a road trip to a few cool spots in Tennesee and saw several cool waterfalls that weekend.
